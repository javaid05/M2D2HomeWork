/* EXERCISE 1
            For every Album displayed in the page we'd like to have a consistent appearence.
            Create the template of an Album component (you can start from a bootstrap one or create your own)
            You will use it to display every album in the page.
            
            You should have consistency in these elements:
            - The album card
            - The album cover
            - The album title
            - The album group / singer / dj
            - The album genre
            - The album duration
            - etc

            create CSS rules to style them if needed
            ...to make sure every Album component looks the same.
